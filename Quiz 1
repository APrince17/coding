# 1. Name and describe three (3) built-in functions in python. 
# Please write your responses in complete sentences.

# Three built-in functions in Python are: print, input, and int. 

# 2. What data type will the following snippet of code output?
print(30/ 232)
# The output will be a float data type.

# 3.  Identify and name the operator family each of the following
# symbols belongs to.

# and logic 
# == equality
# > comparison

# 4. Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator.
# Please write your response in complete sentences.

# The = operator is used for assignment like a variable, while the ==  is used to checks if two values are equal.

# 5. Write code that takes a userâ€™s input (as a string), 
# casts it to a float, and prints the result multiplied by 2.

input1 = input("Enter a number: ")
result = float(input1) * 2
print(result)

# 6. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
# Please write your response in complete sentences.

# A parameter is a variable in the declaration of a function, while an argument is the actual value of this variable that gets passed to the function.

# 7. What is the difference between a function definition 
# and a function invocation? # Please write your response in 
# complete sentences.

# A function definition is the code that defines what the function does, while a function invocation calls the function to execute its defined behavior.

# 8. Why are functions useful in programming? Provide at least two reasons 
# and write your reasons in in complete sentences.

# It can be useful for using the function multipul times without having to recode it every time.

# 9. Write a code block that uses the appropriate operator for each scenario
x = 15
y = 20.
# x is greater than y
print(x > y, "x > y")

# x and 15 are both the same

print(x == 15, "x == 15")

# x and y are not the same`

print(x != y, "x != y")

# 10. Create a function that will take in two values. Your function should
# take in 1 value as a parameter, and the other value should be passed in by the
# user through the terminal. Your function should compare if the number passed in by
# the user is greater than the number passed in via the parameter and should print out
# the appropriat response of true or false.


def q10(input4):
    input3 = input("type a number: ") 
    print('The result is', float(input3) > input4)
